-> Create a React app using vite: npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react

-> Redux
- A pattern
- A Library
- Independent of Frameworks
- State management in JS
- Avoids prop drilling
- Global store: access can be from anywhere
- change state from anywhere

-> When to use Redux?
- Big Applications
- High frequency of state changes

-> Redux pattern

Store, State, Action, 
Action: a plain JS object, (Type + Payload)
Action doesn't directly change state
Reducer: changes state
Reducer: a pure function
Reducer takes two things: state and action, and returns new state
Dispatch: function which dispatches action
Store: state + reducer + dispatch
Action creator: function which returns an action(object)
dispatch runs immediately, doesn't wait

Make action name constants and assign variable to them

Principles of Redux:
1. Global State: single source of truth
2. Immutable updates: state read-only
3. Reducer should be pure: no side effects

Immutability:
-> Don't change state directly, return a new object from reducer
-> If we are keeping a track of old state, then old state(s) will also be changed if we directly change the state 

Middlewares:

-> React-Redux
- React doesn't know about redux variables
- React only updates UI when we change state variable(made with useState hook)
- Linking state of react with redux is the primary use of react-redux
- Wrap top level App component in <Provider> from 'react-redux'
- useSelector: A hook to access redux store's state 
- useDispatch : A hook to access redux store's dispatch

-> Redux Toolkit
- configureStore to setup store 
- We make slices(by createSlice)
- createSlice takes three params: name, initialState and reducers
- We can export action creators(same name as reducers) and whole reducer from the slice
- react-redux doesn't come along redux toolkit, we have to install it separately



-> Things to learn:
- json-server module
- redxu-thunk
- reducer function to be used in thunk
- three actions: pending, success and failed
